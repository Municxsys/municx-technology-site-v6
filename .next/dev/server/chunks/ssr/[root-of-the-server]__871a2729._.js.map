Our premise: complexity should become clarity.\n        We build tools that help researchers, teams and enterprises measure, visualize and act on the hidden dynamics inside data — from wave coherence to cognitive patterns.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className=\"mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold\">F_QW — a working model</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2 max-w-3xl text-white/70\">\n        As a pragmatic model, F_QW bundles key signals (coherence, velocity, potential) into a single metric to compare states across domains.\n        It is not doctrine; it is an evolving tool to reason about signals over time, design experiments, and challenge our assumptions with replicable tests.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className=\"mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold\">Aurora Layer</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2 max-w-3xl text-white/70\">\n        Our design language: dark glass surfaces with subtle light. A calm cognitive surface that reduces noise and sharpens focus.\n        It carries from the website to the apps, so users always know they operate inside the Municx field.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className=\"mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold\">Why it matters</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2 max-w-3xl text-white/70\">\n        We aim to bridge research and real-world decisions — from solo explorers to regulated enterprise environments.\n        The goal is not merely to observe complexity, but to shape it responsibly.\n      </p>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;AAAA;;;AAEe,SAAS;IACtB,qBACE,8OAAC,mIAAS;;0BACR,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAA+B;;;;;;0BAC7C,8OAAC;gBAAE,WAAU;0BAA+B;;;;;;0BAK5C,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAA+B;;;;;;0BAC7C,8OAAC;gBAAE,WAAU;0BAA+B;;;;;;0BAK5C,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAA+B;;;;;;0BAC7C,8OAAC;gBAAE,WAAU;0BAA+B;;;;;;0BAK5C,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAA+B;;;;;;0BAC7C,8OAAC;gBAAE,WAAU;0BAA+B;;;;;;;;;;;;AAMlD","debugId":null}}]
