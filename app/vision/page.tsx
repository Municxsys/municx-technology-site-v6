        Municx explores the border where scientific rigor meets human-centered design. Our premise: complexity should become clarity.
        We build tools that help researchers, teams and enterprises measure, visualize and act on the hidden dynamics inside data — from wave coherence to cognitive patterns.

      <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">F_QW — a working model</h2>
      <p className="mt-2 max-w-3xl text-white/70">
        As a pragmatic model, F_QW bundles key signals (coherence, velocity, potential) into a single metric to compare states across domains.
        It is not doctrine; it is an evolving tool to reason about signals over time, design experiments, and challenge our assumptions with replicable tests.

      <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">Aurora Layer</h2>
      <p className="mt-2 max-w-3xl text-white/70">
        Our design language: dark glass surfaces with subtle light. A calm cognitive surface that reduces noise and sharpens focus.
        It carries from the website to the apps, so users always know they operate inside the Municx field.

      <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">Why it matters</h2>
      <p className="mt-2 max-w-3xl text-white/70">
        We aim to bridge research and real-world decisions — from solo explorers to regulated enterprise environments.
        The goal is not merely to observe complexity, but to shape it responsibly.
